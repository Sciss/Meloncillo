<h1>Plug-Ins Prefs : Audio Rate</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo does not care about audio processing at all. The value specified here is available to LISP scripts via <code>(gethash "AUDIORATE" (gethash "PREFERENCES" cillo))</code>. It may be used in those scripts to be passed to the offline bounce application, for example.

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this field doesn't influence realtime <A HREF="SuperCollider.html">SuperCollider</A> which is started manually. However, for the plug-ins to not get confused, this value should reflect the current sample rate of scsynth!
