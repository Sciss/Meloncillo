<h1>Filter Trajectories : Vector Transformation Application Settings</h1>
<p>
In cartesian mode, the X and Y coordinate of the trajectories can be individually transform by marking the corresponding checkbox. In polar mode, the transforms affect radius and angle individually.
</p><p>
The combo box next to the checkboxes is used to select the kind of transformation:
</p>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="VectorTransformApplyFunction.html">Apply Function...</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="VectorTransformRaiseMultiply.html">Raise and Multiply...</A></LI>
</UL>
<p>
'Apply Function' can be used to generate a synthetic trajectory path (using
the Replace-Values mode) or to modify existing trajectories (using the Add
or Multiply mode). For example, if you want to create a circular movement
around the surface center with radius 0.25, there are two ways to accomplish that:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Use cartesian mode and central anchor point (0.5,0.5). For X and Y coordinate apply a bipolar Sine function replacement with amplitude 0.25 and phases 0 and 90 degrees respectively for counterclockwise movement or 0 and -90 degrees for clockwise movement.</LI>
<LI>Use polar mode and central anchor point (0.5,0.5). For radius apply a constant replacement of amplitude 0.25 (bipolar). For angle apply a falling sawtooth if you want counterclockwise movement or a rising sawtooth if you want a clockwise movement. The sawtooth should have amplitude 1.0 (bipolar) and 1.0 periods, 0 degree phase.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Note that the <STRONG>noise generator has a bug</STRONG> with trajectory filtering which results in jumps between processing 'blocks' for beta greater than zero. Before this is fixed, you could write a CSound plug-in replacement instead.
