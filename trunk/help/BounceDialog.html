<h1>Bounce-to-Disk Dialog</h1>
<p>
The Bounce-to-Disk dialog is used to render audio results to harddisk in offline. The 'Plug-In'
combo box lists all available plug-ins. The 'Resampling' field and the local 'Settings' menu are
currently not used. When 'Selection Only' is checked, rendering is applied only to the current
timeline selection, if unchecked the whole session is rendered. The bottom half of the dialog
shows the plug-in parameters. Pressing the 'Close' button will cancel the dialog. Pressing the
'Render' button will run the plug-in and render results to harddisk.
</P><P>
Note that in version 0.73 <STRONG>due to a bug</STRONG>, the dialog has to be closed and re-opened when you alter any session objects (e.g. soloing or muting a receiver is not recognized unless you press close and then re-open!). don't use the frame's close gadget, use the close button!
