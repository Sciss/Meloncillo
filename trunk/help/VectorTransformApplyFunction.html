<h1>The Apply-Function-Transform</h1>
<p>
The transformation is basically a function generator. There are
two types of functions: periodic and nonperiodic functions. Periodic
functions are the falling and rising sawtooth, triangle, sine and square wave.
These are characterized by a frequency and a phase. The frequency is expressed in periods
per vector length. For example, in the <A HREF="ReceiverEditor.html">receiver's
sensitivity editor</A>, choosing a sine with four periods results in a
distance or rotation table that is filled with four periods of a sine wave.
Likewise, when applying <A HREF="FilterVectorTransform.html">vector transform trajectory
filtering</A>, the trajectory between the beginning and ending of the timeline
selection is filled with four periods of a sine wave. The phase is given in degrees
where 360 degrees equals one complete cycle and produces the same result as 0 degrees.
To produce a cosine wave, select the sine function and 90 degree phase. Note that the falling
sawtooth starts at its maximum value and the rising sawtooth starts at its minimum value.
The square wave starts at its positive halfwave. Phases can be specified as negative values,
such as -60 degrees.

Aperiod functions are
the constant, noise and the gaussian bell (which is not yet implemented!).

Each function generates a range of values whose margin is called amplitude. Values
can be unipolar which means they are always positive and zero is the minimum value,
or they can be bipolar which means their extreme values reach plus or minus the
amplitude value. Hence, in bipolar mode, the amplitude of a sine wave specifies the
half wave amplitude, while the peak-peak amplitude is actually twice as big. So in
bipolar mode, a sine of amplitude 1.0 will oscillate between -1.0 and +1.0, while
in unipolar mode, a sine of amplitude 1.0 will oscillate between 0.0 and 1.0. Note that
amplitude can be specified as a negative value which produces a phase reversed (inverted)
wave. For noise it's difficult to specify an amplitude. In this case, care is taken
that practically all values lie within the amplitude range. The constant simply produces
a 'DC offset' of the given amplitude.

The noise generator is an algorithm by Paul Bourke and has an additional argument, the
beta value which describes the speed of the oscillation. A beta of 0.0 is white noise,
a beta of 1.0 is pink noise, a beta of 2.0 is brownian noise. Try much higher values for
slowly moving random walks.

Application specifies how the function generator interacts with the previous vector
content. 'Replace Values' simply overwrites to previous content, 'Add Values' adds the
function generator output to the previous content, and 'Multiply Values' multiplies
(modulates) the previous content with the function generator output.
