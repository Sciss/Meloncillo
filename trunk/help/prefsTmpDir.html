<h1>General Prefs : Temporary Folder</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo creates a couple of temporary files which will be deleted automatically when
a session is closed or the program is quit. On Un*x systems, they should go to <code>&quot;/var/tmp&quot;</code>,
but you may want to choose a folder on a different harddisk if your system partition is small, for example.
