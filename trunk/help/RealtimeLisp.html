<h1>Realtime Lisp Plug-In</h1>
<p>
The Lisp Plug-In is a meta-plug-in, i.e. it bridges between the bounce-to-disk interface of Meloncillo and a user-programmable Lisp algorithm. The Lisp algorithm itself is usually also a meta-algorithm because it bridges Meloncillo and other realtime synthesis software such as SuperCollider.
</p><p>
The 'Lisp Source' combo box holds a list of source code files which are specified in the <A HREF="prefsLispRealtimeList.html">Lisp Realtime Source List</A> preferences. Selecting an item from the list will load the new source code, pre-compile it and execute a special GUI building function which is described below. When developing a Lisp script, you often have to fix bugs and reload the source code. The source code needs to be edited in a separate program such as BBEdit or Xcode and be saved in plain ASCII text. To reload the source into Meloncillo, press the 'Reload' button. Jatha will evaluate one complete Lisp expression after another and, if 'Verbose' is checked, each result of this evaluation is printed into the <A HREF="MainLogPane.html">main window's log pane<A>. Compilation or evaluation exceptions and errors are printed to this pane, too. Therefore, when a script is erroreous, activating the verbose mode is useful to find the location of the mistake (Jatha doesn't know 'source code line numbers' by now, unfortunately).
</p><p>
When the script was evaluated, it should have defined a set of Lisp functions which are then used to build the GUI and control the realtime interaction:
</p>
<UL>
<LI><code>(defun create-gui NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called by Meloncillo when the Realtime Plug-In Dialog is opened and a Lisp source is (re)loaded. If you do not need a GUI you can omit this function. The function should return a boolean success status, i.e. the last statement should return either <code>T</code> (success) or <code>NIL</code> (failure). The most prominent special commands you will want to use inside the function are <code><A HREF="lispGadgetMake.html">gadget-make</A></code> which tells Meloncillo to create a new GUI widget such as a number field or path field, and <code><A HREF="lispSessionPropertyAdd.html">session-property-add</A></code> to add new attributes to transmitters and receivers (displayed in the observer palette).
</LI>
<LI><code>(defun prepare NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : the prepare function is called by Meloncillo when the user activates realtime synthesis by pressing the ball-icon in the <A HREF="TransportPalette.html">transport palette</A>. The function is called without any parameters, however there is a global object named <code>cillo</code> which contains preferences and session information and which is described in detail in a <A HREF="lispCilloSymbol.html">separate document</A>. The <code>prepare</code> function should make calls to the special commands <code><A HREF="lispRealtimeSourceRequest.html">source-request</A></code> and <code><A HREF="lispRealtimeTargetRequest.html">target-request</A></code> to inform Meloncillo about the stream data it wants and synchronization issues. The <code>prepare</code> function should return with a boolean <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code> to indicate failure. When preparation fails, the <code>cleanup</code> function is called and rendering is aborted. Otherwise the transport actions are forwarded to the functions <code>play</code>, <code>stop</code> and <code>position</code>.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun play (timeoff) <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called by Meloncillo when transport is started (user presses the play button). <code>timeoff</code> is the transport position upon playback start in seconds. <code>play</code> should return <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code> to indicate failure.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun stop (timeoff) <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is similar to <code>play</code> but is called when the transport is stopped (user presses stop button). <code>stop</code> should return <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code> to indicate failure.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun position (timeoff) <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is similar to <code>play</code> but is called when the transport jumps to a new position (user drags timeline position or playback loop is restarted). <code>position</code> should return <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code> to indicate failure.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun cleanup NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called by Meloncillo either when realtime synthesis is disabled or when it was aborted due to cancellation or an error.</LI>
</UL>
