<h1>Realtime Plug-In Dialog</h1>
<p>
The Realtime Plug-In dialog is used to select and configure a plug-in for realtime sound synthesis. Only one plug-in can be used at a time. The 'Plug-In'
combo box lists all available plug-ins. The 'Settings' menu is
currently not used. The area below the plug-in name is used by the plug-in to display its settings. The plug-in is made active by clicking the ball-icon in the <A HREF="TransportTools.html">transport palette</A>. The plug-in settings can be modified only when the plug-in is inactive.
</P><P>
Note that in version 0.73 <STRONG>due to a bug</STRONG>, the dialog should always kept open when the plug-in is active. An exception occurs when creating or deleting session objects, unless the plug-in is made temporarily inactive!
