<h1>The Flip-and-Shift-Transform</h1>
<p>
This transformation allows you to flip (mirror) and shift (move) a vector horizontally (along
the X-axis) or vertically (along the Y-axis). Y-flipping will take the allowed vector's minimum
and maximum value into account such that after flipping, samples which originally had the
maximum value will have the minimum value and vice versa. X-flipping will place the first sample
at the vector's end and vice versa.
</p><p>
Shifting will clip values to the allowed maximum and minimum of the vector. Some vectors allow
wrapping, for example the rotation table of the <A HREF="ReceiverEditor.html">receiver's
sensitivity editor</A>. Samples shifted 'out of' the right margin will reappear at the left
margin and vice versa. The horizontal shifting amount is normalized to 1.0 which is a complete
'360 degree' shift. Negative values shift to the left.
