<h1>Line Surface Tool</h1>
<p>
The line tool (keyboard <code>F2</code>) is used to draw straight linear
transmitter trajectories.
</P>

<P>
First select the transmitter(s) to edit in the timeline frame's
<A HREF="TransmitterTrack.html">track list</A>. Then make a timeline selection
using either the <A HREF="TimelineAxis.html">timeline axis</A> or the
observer's <A HREF="ObserverTimeline.html">timeline tab</A>. <code>Click+Drag</code>
on the surface to draw the line. A default shape
will be drawn in light blue colour and can be adjusted by dragging one of the crosshair
shaped anchor points. To render the shape hit <code>Return</code>. To cancel the
rendering hit <code>Escape</code>. At any time you can activate or deactive the Snap
function from the View menu. When activated, anchor points are snapped to neighbouring
transmitter positions or receiver anchors (center points).
</p><p>
Two anchor points define the line start and stop and correspond to the timeline
selection's start and stop.
</p><p>
By default the movement will have constant speed. To enter variable speed mode, double
click on the surface. The anchor points are replaced by new anchor points which control
the velocity of the movement corresponding to the timeline selection start and stop
respectively. A transparent yellow shape indicates the velocity. Dragging the anchor
points farer away from the center will increase velocity and vice versa. Velocity is
interpolated between the start and stop point in order to retain the total timeline
selection's duration. The algorithm will keep acceleration (dv/dt) constant.
</p><p>
To concatenate successive paths, hit <code>Ctrl+Return</code>. After the current gesture
is rendered, the timeline selection will be advanced by its duration and the new initial
drag is started automatically at the end of the previous path.
</p><p>
To prevent sudden jumps or 'clicks' at the timeline selection start and stop, activate the
<A HREF="ToolBlending.html">blending mode</A> which will apply an adjustable fade-in
and fade-out of the rendered paths.
