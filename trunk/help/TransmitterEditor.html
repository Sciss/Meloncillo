<h1>Transmitter Trajectory Track</h1>
<p>
In the timeline frame all active transmitters are listed vertically, where each
row shows the transmitter's trajectory. The transmitter's name is shown
on the left margin and is used for <A HREF="TransmitterTrack.html">selection
or deselection</A> purposes.

Each trajectory is separated into a horizontal X-position view and a
vertical Y-position view. The visible time window is determined by the
<A HREF="TimelineScroll.html">timeline scrollbar</A>. Depending on the degree
of zoom, a different downsampled version of the trajectory is shown. Repeatedly
increasing the <A HREF="TimelineToolZoom.html">zoom</A> allows you to zoom to 'sample level'. You can alter
the trajectory by directly 'drawing' into the X and Y views, using the <A HREF="TimelineToolPencil.html">timeline pencil
tool</A>. Note that the
<A HREF="ToolBlending.html">blending mode</A> is useful to prevent sudden
jumps when drawing directly. However, usually you'll want to edit trajectory
tracks by using tools on the <A HREF="Surface.html">surface</A>, such as the
<A HREF="SurfaceToolLine.html">surface line tool</A> or <A HREF="SurfaceToolPencil.html">surface pencil
tool</A>.
</p><p>
Portions of the trajectory can be removed, cutted, copied and pasted using the Edit menu. The menu affects all currently selected transmitters and the time window specified by the timeline selection which can be adjusted in the <A HREF="TimelineAxis.html">timeline axis</A> or by using the <A HREF="TimelineToolPointer.html">timeline pointer
tool</A>. The selected transmitter's trajectories can be filtered inside the timeline selection by calling the <A HREF="FilterDialog.html">'Filter Trajectories'</A> item from
the Timeline menu.
