<h1>Observer Group Tab</h1>
<p>
The receiver tab shows information about the selected receiver: Its name, anchor point location
and dimension. Each parameter may be altered by editing the corresponding textfield and hitting
<code>Return</code>.
</p>

<p>
Illegal values are reset to their limiting values; the anchor point may lie anywhere on the surface
between the top left (0,0) and the bottom right (1,1), the size may be up to (1,1). Please note that
the receiver's name is not checked for validity; to avoid confusion, duplicate names should be avoided.
Some plug-ins may deduce behaviour from the receivers' names such as the corresponding output channel.
</p><p>
If more than one receiver is selected, identical values are still shown and may be edited, while
differing parameters are shown as a special NaN character. For instance, if two receivers are selected
both of which have size (1,1) but are have different anchor points, the anchor point fields display
the special NaN character while the size field states a width and height of 1.0. Changing the width
to 2.0, for example, will affect both receivers likewise.
