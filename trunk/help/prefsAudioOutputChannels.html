<h1>Plug-Ins Prefs : Audio Hardware Outputs</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo does not care about audio processing at all. The value specified here is available
to LISP scripts via <code>(gethash "OUTPUTCHANNELS" (gethash "PREFERENCES" cillo))</code>.
For example, in <A HREF="SuperCollider.html">SuperCollider</A>, audio busses are automatically routed to the sound card's
output interface for channel indices smaller than the number of specified output channels.
</p>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this field doesn't influence realtime SuperCollider which is started manually. However, for the plug-ins to not get confused, this value should be greater or equal than the number of audio outputs specified when launching scsynth!
