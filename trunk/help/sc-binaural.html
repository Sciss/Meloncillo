<h1>Lisp Plug-In : SuperCollider Binaural Synthesis</h1>
<P>
this plug-in uses convolution with head-related impulse-respones (HRIR) and is in beta state. it uses supercollider's <code>Convolution2</code> ugen which is not available on the windows platform at the moment (april 2005).
</P>
<H3>preparation</H3>
<P>
it was designed to work with the HRIR library from the ircam listen project. you can preview the different HRIR's online to find the one that best matches your head (i.e. sounds the most natural). once you have downloaded and uncompressed the HRIR folder, you need to run the preparation module from meloncillo's debug menu: put the folder that contains the <code>IRC_XXXX_R_R0195_TYYY_PZZZ.wav</code> files in the input field (you can use either the subfolder of the <code>RAW</code> or the <code>COMPENSATED</code> folder). select an output folder. press &quot;Process&quot;.
</P>
<p>the preparation dialog splits the impulse response into separate left/ right mono aiff files and truncates them to a size of 1024 frames which is sufficient and less CPU intensive than the full length responses. a list of files named <code>hrtfXXXl.aif</code> and <code>hrtfXXXr.aif</code> is created in the output folder.
</P>
<P>in the realtime plug-in frame select this output folder in the &quot;HRIR Folder&quot; field.

<H3>session object properties</H3>
<P>
this plug-in requires that you create at least one group. each group must contain one receiver whose anchor specifies the head position, and two transmitters for azimuth and elevation control. in the observer palette, chose &quot;Azimuth&quot; as the role of the first transmitter and &quot;Elevation&quot; as the role of the second transmitter. note that this is beta state, the synthesizer will ignore elevation at the moment, nevertheless you have to create an elevation transmitter!
</P>
<P>the orientation is such that north is in front of your head, south is behind your head, west is left to your head and east is right to your head. this plug-in does not use any volume or distance control at the moment. the azimuth trajectory has to be very slowly moving, otherwise you will hear clicks! also note that the azimuth is only sampled every fifteen degrees, so when moving you will here colourization artifacts from impulse interpolation.
</P>
<P>
a demo session is included in the tutorial files archive which can be downloaded separately from the meloncillo sourceforge site.
