<h1>Blending Mode</h1>
<p>
When the blending mode is activated (keyboard <code>Caps-Lock</code>), some trajectory
editing operations are blended in and out at the operation's punch in and out points.

<p>
The amount of blending is specified in a separate dialog which will be opened when you
<code>Alt+Click</code> on the blending mode icon. Suppose a blending of 0.5 sec. is activated.
Drawing a line using the <A HREF="SurfaceToolLine.html">line tool</A> when the timeline
selection is (4.0 sec. ... 6.0 sec.) will create a linear fade-in from 4.0 sec. to 4.5 sec.
and a linear fade-out from 5.5 sec. to 6.0 sec.
</p>
<p>
Blending works with the surface tools <A HREF="SurfaceToolLine.html">line</A>, <A HREF="SurfaceToolCurve.html">curve</A>,
<A HREF="SurfaceToolArc.html">arc</A> and <A HREF="SurfaceToolPencil.html">pencil</A>, affects
direct drawing to the <A HREF="TransmitterEditor.html">trajectory timeline tracks</A> and applying
a <A HREF="FilterDialog.html">trajectory filter</A>. In a future version, blending will also
apply to cut and paste clipboard operations and offer a polar (instead of cartesian) mode.
