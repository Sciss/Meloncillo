<h1>Filter Trajectories : Lisp Plug-In</h1>
<p>
The Lisp Plug-In is a meta-plug-in, i.e. it bridges between the filter interface of Meloncillo
and a user-programmable Lisp algorithm. The Lisp algorithm itself is usually also a meta-algorithm
because it bridges Meloncillo and other signal processing software such as CSound. Since the
Lisp interpreter Jatha doesn't handle arrays yet and besides is too slow, there is no direct way
of transforming trajectories inside a Lisp script. However there are commands for executing external
programs, reading and writing to files and requesting trajectory data to be submitted and reinserted
into the session.
</p><p>
The 'Lisp Source' combo box holds a list of source code files which are specified in the
<A HREF="prefsLispFilterList.html">Lisp Filter Source List</A> preferences. Selecting an item from
the list will load the new source code, pre-compile it and execute a special GUI building function
which is described below. When developing a Lisp script, you often have to fix bugs and reload the
source code. The source code needs to be edited in a separate program such as BBEdit or Xcode and
be saved in plain ASCII text. To reload the source into Meloncillo, press the 'Reload' button.
Jatha will evaluate one complete Lisp expression after another and, if 'Verbose' is checked, each
result of this evaluation is printed into the <A HREF="MainLogPane.html">main window's log pane<A>.
Compilation or evaluation exceptions and errors are printed to this pane, too. Therefore, when a
script is erroreous, activating the verbose mode is useful to find the location of the mistake
(Jatha doesn't know 'source code line numbers' by now, unfortunately).
</p><p>
When the script was evaluated, it should have defined a set of Lisp functions which are then
used to build the GUI and control the trajectory filtering:
</p>
<UL>
<LI><code>(defun create-gui NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called
by Meloncillo when the Filter Trajectories Dialog is opened and a Lisp source is (re)loaded. If
you do not need a GUI you can omit this function. The function should return a boolean success
status, i.e. the last statement should return either <code>T</code> (success) or <code>NIL</code>
(failure). The most prominent special command you will want to use inside the function is
<code><A HREF="lispGadgetMake.html">gadget-make</A></code> which tells Meloncillo to
create a new GUI widget such as a number field or path field.
</LI>
<LI><code>(defun prepare NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : the prepare function is
called by Meloncillo when the user presses the 'Render' button of the Filter Trajectories dialog.
The function is called without any parameters, however there is a global object named <code>cillo</code>
which contains preferences and session information and which is described in detail in a
<A HREF="lispCilloSymbol.html">separate document</A>. The <code>prepare</code> function should make calls to
the special commands <code><A HREF="lispFilterSourceRequest.html">source-request</A></code> and
<code><A HREF="lispFilterTargetRequest.html">target-request</A></code> to inform Meloncillo about
the data it wants and the data which should be reinserted into the session. The <code>prepare</code>
function should return with a boolean <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code>
to indicate failure. When preparation fails, the <code>cleanup</code> function is called and
rendering is aborted. Otherwise the requested trajectory data is prepared and <code>render</code>
will be called.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun render NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called by
Meloncillo when the <code>prepare</code> call was successfull and all data requested using
<code><A HREF="lispFilterSourceRequest.html">source-request</A></code> has been submitted.
Therefore, in the <code>render</code> function you usually make a call to an external program
using the <code><A HREF="lispExecute.html">execute</A></code> command. Finally, you should, again,
return <code>T</code> to indicate success or a boolean <code>NIL</code> to indicate failure.</LI>
<LI><code>(defun cleanup NIL <var>your-function-body</var>)</code> : this function is called by
Meloncillo either when rendering is complete or when it was aborted due to cancellation or an
error. Use it to close files, destroy temporary files and buffers and so on.</LI>
</UL>
