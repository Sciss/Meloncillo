<h1>Main Progress Bar</h1>
<p>
Some processes might take a few seconds or even longer to finish. These processes
run in an asynchronous thread and report their progress by animating this progress
bar. For longer processes such as bouncing to disk, an estimation of the remaining
time is displayed as HH:MM:SS, but due to the linear extrapolation don't expect this
to be too accurate. 
</p><p>
When a process is finished, the bar turns green in case of success and red in case
of failure.
