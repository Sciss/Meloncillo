<h1>Plug-Ins Prefs : SuperCollider OSC Socket (IP:port)</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo does not care about audio processing at all. The value specified here is available
to LISP scripts via <code>(gethash "SUPERCOLLIDEROSC" (gethash "PREFERENCES" cillo))</code>. Scripts
using realtime <A HREF="SuperCollider.html">SuperCollider</A> can use this value as a socket target address. The value can likewise
be used for a Max/MSP client running the MeloncilloMaxBridge and using the same socket address.
</p><p>
The socket address is expressed in the form <code>IP:port</code>. When running Meloncillo and the synthesis
application on the same machine, you can use the localhost IP address '127.0.0.1'. SuperCollider's
standard OSC port is 57110.
</p>
<P>
The IP address can be specified both as a number, e.g. <code>123.45.67.8</code>, or as a human readable name that is known by your network's name server, e.g. <code>schnucki.hfm-weimar.de</code>. Note that the plug-ins use UDP for communication at the moment. There is a <STRONG>safety issue</STRONG> about running scsynth via UDP in public networks such as a university computer. This issue will be addressed in a future version of Meloncillo.
