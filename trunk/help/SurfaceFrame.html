<h1>Surface Frame</h1>
<p>
The surface frame can be opened from the window menu (<code>Meta+Numpad-*</code>). The right side shows the <A HREF="Surface.html">surface</A>, which the spatial setting of the session with optional display of receiver sensitivities and transmitter trajectories. It is what is called the &quot;canvas&quot; in video editing software such as final cut. On the top border you see the surface toolbar controlling the modes of editing on the surface.

The surface is separated from two <A HREF="SurfaceObjectTables.html">object tables</A> on the left margin of the window. These tables are hidden by default and can be made visible by clicking on the vertical split bar of the window. The tables show a list of all receivers and groups in the session. The selection of groups affects which objects are shown on the surface and in the <A HREF="TimelineFrame.html">timeline frame</A>.
