<h1>Observer Receiver Tab</h1>
<p>
The receiver tab shows information about the selected receiver: Its name, anchor point location and, for <A HREF="SigmaReceiver.html">sigma receivers</A>, dimension. Each parameter may be altered by editing the corresponding textfield and hitting <code>Return</code>.
</p>

Illegal values are reset to their limiting values; the anchor point may lie anywhere on the surface between the top left (0,0) and the bottom right (1,1), the size may be up to (1,1). When you select View-&gt;Surface Shows-&gt;Rulers, the coordinate system is displayed in the surface frame. Please note that the receiver's name must be unique, duplicate names are not allowed.
</p><p>
If more than one receiver is selected, identical values are still shown and may be edited, while differing parameters are shown as a special NaN character (questionmark-diamond). For instance, if two receivers are selected both of which have size (1,1) but are have different anchor points, the anchor point fields display the special NaN character while the size field states a width and height of 1.0. Changing the width to 2.0, for example, will affect both receivers likewise.
</P><P>
For <A HREF="SectorReceiver.html">sector receiver's</A>, the inner and outer diameter as well as the start angle and angle extent are shown.
</P><P>
To edit a receiver's sensitivity, open its editor by double clicking on its red anchor crosshair on the surface pane, using the <A HREF="SurfaceToolPointer.html">surface pointer tool</A>.
</P><P>
More fields are shown depending on the chosen <A HREF="RealtimeDialog.html">realtime plug-in</A>. For example, plug-ins may wish to associate a receiver with a auxiliary audio file or a soundcard channel.
