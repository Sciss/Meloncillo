<h1>The Raise-and-Multiply-Transform</h1>
<p>
This transformation raises each sample of the input vector to the power of
a given value (when 'Raise to the Power' is checked) and then multiplies
the result by a given value (when 'Multiply' is checked). For input values
between 0.0 and 1.0, the results of raising them to the power of 2 and
raising them to the power of 0.5 (i.e. taking the square root) are shown
in the image below.
