<h1>Plug-Ins Prefs : Realtime Max. Sense Rate</h1>
<p>
The session's default sense data sampling rate is 1 kHz which is quite high when compared
to our ear's sensitivity regarding azimuth detection of a sound source, for example. However
there are many reasons for keeping the sense rate high, for example to retain high quality
even after several steps of trajectory filtering or for experimenting with audio rate modulations.
When playing back the session in realtime mode, such a data rate might be too high for your
network connection or CPU load. Therefore, adjusting this preferences, you can limit the realtime
data rate to an integer fraction of the session data rate.
</p><p>
Note that downsampling is restricted to a power of two, i.e. if your session rate is 1 kHz, the
realtime sense rate can be either 1 kHz, 500 Hz, 250 Hz, 125 Hz, 62.5 Hz etc. The value entered
in the preferences is automatically downgraded to the next possible value, for example, if you specifiy
300 Hz, data is sent at 250 Hz.
</p><p>
The preference's value is available in LISP scripts via <code>(gethash "SENSERATE" (gethash "PREFERENCES" cillo))</code>.
If you recognize drop-outs in realtime mode, either decrease the maximum sense buffer rate or
decrease the <A HREF="prefsRTSenseBufSize.html">sense buffer size</A>.
