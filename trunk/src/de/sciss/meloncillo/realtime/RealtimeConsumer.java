 *	The consumer registers with the transport when
 *	it wants to start to receive information. The
 *	transport will query the consumer's profile
 *	using <code>createRequest</code> and ask
 *	the realtime producer to integrate this new
 *	profile. Depending on the settings of the profile,
 *	some of the other tick and block methods of the
 *	consumer get called.
