/**
 *	A transmitter is one of the two main
 *	objects contained in a session. It is
 *	maintained by the session's <code>TransmitterCollection</code>.
 *	A transmitter represents a dynamic point object
 *	that has a trajectory attached describing the movement
 *	in time.
 *  <p>
 *	The <code>Transmitter</code> interface is a
 *	general description of a transmitter,
 *	giving it a name
 *	and providing a method for querying
 *	a trajectory editor. Additional
 *	methods deal with data storage
 *	(<code>set/getDirectory</code>).
 *  <p>
 *  All coordinates are defined for
 *  the virtual space (0,0) ... (1,1)
