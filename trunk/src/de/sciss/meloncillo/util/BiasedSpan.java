/**
 *  A span object that
 *  contains an additional bias.
 *  This is used for subsampled
 *  trajectory tracks. It means
 *  that though the normal span
 *  start and stop are accurate,
 *  the datastructure referenced
 *  by this span, has some coarse
 *  raster which produces roundoff
 *  errors (bias). In order to
 *  avoid the roundoff errors to
 *  grow, a biased span is used.
 *  This allows the object to keep
 *  the maximum bias within the limit
 *  of its coarsity.
 *
 *  @author		Hanns Holger Rutz
 *  @version	0.75, 10-Jun-08
 *
 *  @todo   this is not very well designed,
 *			because SubsampledTrackEditor has
 *			to create new BiasedSpan objects
 *			each time a method is called. It would
 *			be easier if relationships were reversed,
 *			i.e. Span was a subclass of BiasedSpan.
 *			However this would cause unnecessary RAM overhead.
 *			We really have to think about this issue.
