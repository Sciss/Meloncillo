<h1>General Prefs : Look-and-Feel</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo is written in Java which is completely platform independant. This raises the need for
a graphical user interface (GUI) to be indepedant of the platform's native look-and-feel. For the
user this may appear to be an inconvenience, however Java allows you to switch to different look-and-feels.
On MacOS, for example, a very smooth integration into the native Aqua interface is achieved through
the 'Mac OS X' look-and-feel.
</p><p>
Sun's VM for Windows doesn't include a Windows look-and-feel but uses
Java's default 'Metal' skin which is pretty ugly. You can easily install other look-and-feels. For example,
a very nice looking free one is 'Metouia', a sourceforge project located at
<A HREF="http://mlf.sourceforge.net/index.php?home" CLASS="ext">mlf.sourceforge.net</A>. The .jar file
needs to be installed somewhere in the classpath, e.g. on Mac OS put it into
<code>&quot;/System/Library/Java/Extensions&quot;</code>, and two lines need to be added to the file
<code>&quot;swing.properties&quot;</code> which resides in <code>&quot;$JAVAHOME/lib&quot;</code> (again on Mac OS X, <code>$JAVAHOME</code> might be <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/home</code>):

<pre>
swing.installedlaf.metouia.name=Metouia
swing.installedlaf.metouia.class=net.sourceforge.mlf.metouia.MetouiaLookAndFeel
</pre>
<p>
Note that some runtime error may occur when switching to a different look-and-feel in the preferences. These are usually harmless, but there's nothing wrong in restarting Meloncillo after having changed the look-and-feel settings.
</p>
<P>
As of v0.73, on non-Mac systems, the liquid look-and-feel will be installed by default.
