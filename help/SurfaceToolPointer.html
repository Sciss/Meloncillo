<h1>Pointer Surface Tool</h1>
<p>
The pointer tool (keyboard <code>F1</code>) is used to select or deselect and drag receivers
on the <A HREF="Surface.html">surface</A>. Single receivers can be selected by clicking on their
anchor point (the red crosshair labelled with the receiver's name). <code>Shift+Click</code>
allows multiple selections. Clicking outside a receiver on the surface will deselect all
receivers. The selected receivers are shown with a blue shading. <code>Click+Drag</code> will
move a single or multiple receivers.
</p><p>
Double clicking on the surface will create a new receiver at the current mouse position. As of version 0.72, this is a SigmaReceiver; to create other classes of receivers, use the menu item File-&gt;Insert-&gt;New Receivers.
</p><p>
Pressing <code>Delete</code> or selecting an item from the Edit menu will affect all currently
selected receivers. Numeric editing and renaming is performed in the <A HREF="ObserverReceiver.html">
receiver tab</A> of the <A HREF="ObserverPalette.html">observer palette</A>. Double clicking on
a receiver's anchor point will open the receiver's <A HREF="ReceiverEditor.html">sensitity
editor</A>.
</p><p>
When the pointer tool is active and the surface frame is focussed, pressing <code>Meta+A</code>
will select all receivers.
</p><p>
The pointer tool does not affect transmitters. They can be selected or deselected in their
corresponding <A HREF="TransmitterTrack.html">tracks</A> in the timeline frame.
