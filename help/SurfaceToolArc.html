<h1>Arc Surface Tool</h1>
<p>
The arc tool (keyboard <code>F4</code>) is used to draw elliptic or arc shaped
transmitter trajectories.
</P>
<IMG SRC="SurfaceToolArc.png">
<P>
First select the transmitter(s) to edit in the timeline frame's
<A HREF="TransmitterTrack.html">track list</A>. Then make a timeline selection
using either the <A HREF="TimelineAxis.html">timeline axis</A> or the
observer's <A HREF="ObserverTimeline.html">timeline tab</A>. <code>Click+Drag</code>
on the surface to draw the container frame of the ellipsis or arc. A default shape
will be drawn in light blue colour and can be adjusted by dragging on of the crosshair
shaped anchor points. To render the shape hit <code>Return</code>. To cancel the
rendering hit <code>Escape</code>. At any time you can activate or deactive the Snap
function from the View menu. When activated, anchor points are snapped to neighbouring
transmitter positions or receiver anchors (center points).
</p><p>
Two anchor points in the top left and bottom right define the arc's container frame.
Two anchor points define the starting and stopping angle where by default the top right
anchor point corresponds to the timeline selection start and the bottom left anchor
point corresponds to the timeline selection stop. A fifth anchor point can be moved
on the arc to determine the orientation of the movement.
</p><p>
By default the movement will have constant speed. To enter variable speed mode, double
click on the surface. The anchor points are replaced by new anchor points which control
the velocity of the movement corresponding to the timeline selection start and stop
respectively. A transparent yellow shape indicates the velocity. Dragging the anchor
points farer away from the arc will increase velocity and vice versa. Velocity is
interpolated between the start and stop point in order to retain the total timeline
selection's duration. The algorithm will keep acceleration (dv/dt) constant.
</p><p>
To concatenate successive paths, hit <code>Ctrl+Return</code>. After the current gesture
is rendered, the timeline selection will be advanced by its duration and the new initial
drag is started automatically at the end of the previous path.
</p><p>
To prevent sudden jumps or 'clicks' at the timeline selection start and stop, activate the
<A HREF="ToolBlending.html">blending mode</A> which will apply an adjustable fade-in
and fade-out of the rendered paths.
