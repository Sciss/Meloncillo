</P>
<UL>
<LI>no trajectories are written. this tool is therefore used to rehearse movements prior to the final recording, or to query the sensitivities at certain spots of the surface.</LI>
<LI>the transport is not automatically started and stopped if not already running.</LI>
</UL>
<p>
Just like the pencil tool, since movements are transmitted as 'buffers' to the realtime plug-in, you while notice a slight delay of the audible movement of sound which corresponds to the <A HREF="prefsRTSenseBufSize.html">realtime sense buffer size</A>.
