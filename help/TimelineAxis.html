<h1>Timeline Axis</h1>
<p>
The timelime axis displays a ruler scaled and positioned such that the labels correspond to the time frame displayed in the trajectory tracks. The units are seconds. The current timeline position used for playback and clipboard pasting is indicated by a vertical red bar which can be shifted by clicking and dragging in the timeline axis. The currently active timeline selection (gray or blue shaded) used for delete, cut and copy operations and loop playback
can be alterted by <code>Shift+Click</code> in the timeline axis. <code>Alt+Click</code> will erase the timeline selection.

The numeric timeline position can be altered in the <A HREF="TransportPosition.html">transport palette</A>. The numeric timeline selection can be altered in the <A HREF="ObserverTimeline.html">time tab</A> of the <A HREF="ObserverPalette.html">observer palette</A>. To quickly return to the session beginning, press <code>Return</code> when the timeline frame is focussed.
</p><p>
A 'bird's view' of the timeline position and selection is shown in the
<A HREF="TimelineScroll.html">timeline scrollbar</A>.

Often, it will be more convenient, to use the timeline's <A HREF="TimelineToolPointer.html">pointer to tool</A> to set the timeline position and selected span.
