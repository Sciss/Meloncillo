<h1>General Prefs : Recall Windows from Session</h1>
<p>
Meloncillo keeps track of the locations and sizes of its windows as well as their visibility
(whether they are shown or hidden). The bounds are saved with each session and checking this
preferences will re-call the saved bounds each time a session is loaded. Unchecking this
preferences will not move windows when a session is loaded.
