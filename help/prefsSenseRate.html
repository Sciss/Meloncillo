<h1>Session Prefs : Sense Rate</h1>
<p>
The trajectory path of each transmitter and the sense
data corresponding to each cell of the receivers/transmitters matrix are so-called
streaming data. The streaming data is digitized and sampled at regular intervals. The
rate of the streaming or sense data is called sense rate and is expressed in Hertz
(samples per second).
</p><p>
The session's default sense data sampling rate is 1 kHz which is quite high when compared
to our ear's sensitivity regarding azimuth detection of a sound source, for example. However
there are many reasons for keeping the sense rate high, for example to retain high quality
even after several steps of trajectory filtering or for experimenting with audio rate modulations.
However, you can change the session's sense rate to an arbitrary value, say 100 Hz, which would
reduce disk size and CPU load to one tenth of a session with a 1 kHz rate.
</p><p>
Note that changing the sense rate after the session has been created will not alter the
trajectory data at all. Therefore changing a session from 1 kHz to 100 Hz will result in
motions being played back at 1/10 of the original speed. You can use this trick intentionally
to slow down or accelerate a session. If you wish to retain the original tempo, use a
resampling mechanism such as a <A HREF="FilterLisp.html">self-programmed trajectory filter</A> or the
<A HREF="FilterTimeWarp.html">time warp trajectory filter</A>.
</p><p>
When played back with a realtime plug-in, the sense data can be decimated by an amount
specified by the <A HREF="prefsRTMaxSenseRate.html">max sense rate prefs</A>.
