deletes the file of the given pathname. note that it is not possible to pass a lisp symbol bound to a file object created using <A HREF="lispFile.html"><code>file-open</code></A>, because that would require the file to have been closed before calling <code>file-delete</code>. closing however releases the object binding to the handle.
