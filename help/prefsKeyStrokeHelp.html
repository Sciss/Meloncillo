<h1>General Prefs : Shortcut for Online Help</h1>
<p>
This preferences determines the keyboard shortcut to activate a window's help mode. By default, it's set to <code>Ctrl+Help</code>. Some keyboards may not have a distinct help key, e.g. PowerBooks. In this case, click inside the text box and type an alternative keyboard accelerator, e.g. <code>Ctrl+Shift+H</code>.

<P>
The window help mode is activated by typing the specified accelerator key. The window will turn blue, and you can move the mouse around to focus the object for which you wish to display online help. Each object that has an associated help document will turn yellow when focussed with the mouse. Often the complete window has a general help document, so move the mouse away from specific components, and the whole window will turn yellow. To view the help document, click with the mouse. To exit help mode, type <code>Escape</code>.
