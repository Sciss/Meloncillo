<h1>Filter Trajectories : Vector Transformation Coordinate Settings</h1>
<p>
In a two dimensional world there are two common coordinate systems, i.e. ways
to describe locations of objects on a plane: The cartesian system uses a X-axis
and a Y-axis. In Meloncillo, the top left corner of the surface has the
coordinates (0,0), the top right is (1,0), the bottom right is (1,1) and the
bottom left is (0,1).
</p><p>
However, often it is convenient to shift the origin of the coordinate system.
In the Vector Transformation dialog you can set the origin using the Center-X and Center-Y fields. If the surface's center should be (0,0), you would set both
values to 0.5, then the top left corner of the surface becomes (-0.5,-0.5) and
the bottom right corner becomes (0.5,0.5).
</p><p>
Another common view is the polar coordinate system, where each point is
described by a distance from and angle to a reference point. The reference point
here again is the Center-X / Center-Y location. If both are set to 0.5, the
top left has radius 0.707 and angle 1.25 (225 degrees). The angle of 0 degrees
is located 'East' and increasing angles travel in clockwise direction.
The angle is normalized so that +/- 1.0 correspond to 180 degrees or 'West',
0.5 corresponds to 90 degrees or 'South' and 1.5 or -0.5 corresponds to 270 or
90 degrees or 'North'.
</p><P>
This system is different from what you have learned about the <A HREF="SectorReceiver.html">Sector Receiver's</A> angular system where zero degrees is north and travels clockwise. <STRONG>This will be unified in the next version.</STRONG>
