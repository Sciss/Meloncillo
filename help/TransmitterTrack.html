row shows the transmitter's trajectory. The transmitter's name is shown
on the left margin. To select a transmitter, click on its name. To select
multiple transmitters or to deselect a transmitter, use <code>Shift+Click</code>.
To select or deselect all transmitters, use <code>Alt+Click</code> on the

having a blue shaded background.

Active transmitters are those that are part of the selected groups. When no groups exist or all groups are deselected, all transmitters of the session are shown. See the <A HREF="SurfaceObjectTables.html">surface object tables</A> document to learn how to use groups.
</P><p>
The selected transmitters are the ones which are affected by surface tools
such as the <A HREF="SurfaceToolLine.html">line tool</A> or the
<A HREF="SurfaceToolPencil.html">pencil tool</A>, as well as by cut/copy/paste operations from the edit menu. They can be removed by
choosing File-&gt;Remove-&gt;Selected Transmitters. Their
views can be vertically magnified or shrinked by typing <code>Ctrl+Cursor Up</code>
and <code>Ctrl+Cursor Down</code> when the timeline frame is focussed.
</P><P>
The 'S' and 'M' buttons toggle the Solo and Mute flags of each transmitter. These flags can be used by the <A HREF="BounceDialog.html">bounce</A> or <A HREF="RealtimeDialog.html">realtime</A> plug-ins and have no meaning in Meloncillo itself. <code>Alt+Click</code> will toggle all active transmitters. <code>Meta+Click</code> on the solo button toggle's solo-safe mode.
</P><P>
Editing their <A HREF="TransmitterEditor.html">trajectory tracks</A> using the <A HREF="TimelineToolPencil.html">timeline pencil tool</A> is independant of the transmitter selection.
</p>
<p>
The selected transmitter's name can be edited in the
<A HREF="ObserverTransmitter.html">transmitter tab</A> of the observer.
