<h1>LISP Functional Extensions : Byte Buffer commands</h1>
<PRE>
(byte-buffer-alloc <var>&lt;id&gt;</var> <var>&lt;size&gt;</var>)

</PRE>
<P>
byte buffers can be seen as some kind of replacement for the missing support of arrays in jatha. they can be used to write arbitrary data into harddisk files (see <A HREF="lispFile.html">the file i/o document</A>) and as a target object in realtime and offline synthesis (see <A HREF="lispRealtimeSourceRequest.html">realtime source-request</A> and <A HREF="lispBounceSourceRequest.html">bounce source-request</A>).
</P>
<P>
byte buffers are addressed through an <A HREF="lispOBoundP.html">object binding</A>: a lisp symbol is passed to the allocation command and can then be used as a &quot;handle&quot; to that buffer when writing or freeing the buffer. the allocation command requires the specification of the size of the buffer in bytes.
</P>
<P>
in <code>byte-buffer-write</code>, four types of primitives can be written to the buffer: a single integer is written as a signed 32bit integer, a single real is written as a 32bit IEEE 754 floating point number, a list of integers is written as a sequence of 8bit bytes! any other type is written as a byte sequence of its string representation (not terminated). the optional <code>repeats</code> argument which must be an integer is used to write the object repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
at the moment it is not possible to seek in the byte buffer. when a new buffer is allocated, the write position is placed at the very beginning. it's not possible to clear or reset the buffer. this will be possible in a future version.
</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
    (byte-buffer-alloc 'testmsg 148)
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg "/b_setn\\0x00,iii")
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg "f" 24)
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg (list 0) 4)
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg 1)  ; (int) buffer number
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg 0)  ; (int) buffer offset
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg 24) ; (int) number of frames
    (byte-buffer-write 'testmsg 0.5 24) ; (floats) frames
    (datagram-channel-open 'scosc "127.0.0.1" 57110)
    (osc-bundle-send-and-wait 'scosc 0.0 (list
        (list "/b_alloc" 1 24)
        (list "/dumpOSC" 3)
        (list "/sync" 1234)
    ) "/synced" 1000)
    (datagram-channel-write 'scosc 'testmsg)
    (datagram-channel-close 'scosc)
    (byte-buffer-free 'testmsg)
</PRE>
<P>
the example allocates a buffer of 148 bytes and creates an OSC message for supercollider. a buffer in supercollider is created (with an ID of 1 and a size of 24 frames). since we wait for the OSC-dumping to be turned on, this message -- which sets the content of sc's buffer to the constant value of 0.5 -- will be printed to the terminal by scsynth. note the excape expression in the first write statement to include zero padding. also note that in <A HREF="lispDatagramChannel.html"><code>datagram-channel-write</code></A>, the whole buffer is sent, therefore when allocating this buffer, the size must be exactly the size of the message. this is going to change in a future version.
